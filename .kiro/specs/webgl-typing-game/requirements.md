# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A 3D typing game built with WebGL and Three.js that provides an engaging and interactive way for users to practice their typing skills. The game will feature 3D environments, visual effects, and progressive difficulty levels to create an immersive typing experience that goes beyond traditional 2D typing games.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Typing Mechanics

**User Story:** As a player, I want to type words or sentences that appear in the 3D environment, so that I can improve my typing skills in an engaging way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a typing session starts THEN the system SHALL display text prompts in the 3D scene
2. WHEN the player types a character THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback for correct/incorrect input
3. WHEN the player completes a word correctly THEN the system SHALL remove the word from the scene with a visual effect
4. WHEN the player makes a typing error THEN the system SHALL highlight the error and allow correction
5. IF the player takes too long to type a word THEN the system SHALL provide a visual warning indicator

### Requirement 2: 3D Visual Environment

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience typing in immersive 3D environments, so that the practice feels more engaging than traditional typing games.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL render a 3D scene using WebGL/Three.js
2. WHEN text appears THEN the system SHALL position words in 3D space with proper depth and perspective
3. WHEN the player interacts with the game THEN the system SHALL provide smooth camera movements and transitions
4. WHEN words are completed THEN the system SHALL display particle effects or animations
5. IF the game supports multiple themes THEN the system SHALL allow switching between different 3D environments

### Requirement 3: Performance Tracking

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see my typing performance metrics, so that I can track my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a typing session is active THEN the system SHALL calculate and display real-time WPM (words per minute)
2. WHEN a typing session is active THEN the system SHALL track accuracy percentage
3. WHEN a session ends THEN the system SHALL display a summary of performance metrics
4. WHEN the player completes multiple sessions THEN the system SHALL store historical performance data
5. IF the player requests statistics THEN the system SHALL show progress charts and trends

### Requirement 4: Progressive Difficulty

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game difficulty to adapt to my skill level, so that I'm appropriately challenged as I improve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new player starts THEN the system SHALL begin with basic words and slower timing
2. WHEN the player demonstrates consistent accuracy THEN the system SHALL increase word complexity
3. WHEN the player maintains high WPM THEN the system SHALL reduce time limits for words
4. WHEN the player struggles with accuracy THEN the system SHALL temporarily reduce difficulty
5. IF the player selects manual difficulty THEN the system SHALL respect the chosen difficulty level

### Requirement 5: Game Modes

**User Story:** As a player, I want different game modes to choose from, so that I can practice different aspects of typing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player accesses game modes THEN the system SHALL offer at least 3 different modes
2. WHEN "Word Rain" mode is selected THEN the system SHALL drop words from above that must be typed before hitting the ground
3. WHEN "Target Practice" mode is selected THEN the system SHALL place words on 3D objects that must be "shot" by typing
4. WHEN "Story Mode" mode is selected THEN the system SHALL present continuous text passages in an immersive environment
5. IF a mode is completed THEN the system SHALL unlock the next difficulty level or new content

### Requirement 6: Audio and Visual Feedback

**User Story:** As a player, I want rich audio and visual feedback for my actions, so that the game feels responsive and satisfying.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player types correctly THEN the system SHALL play satisfying sound effects
2. WHEN the player makes an error THEN the system SHALL provide distinct audio/visual error feedback
3. WHEN words are completed THEN the system SHALL trigger particle effects and success sounds
4. WHEN the player achieves milestones THEN the system SHALL display celebration animations
5. IF the player prefers quiet mode THEN the system SHALL allow disabling audio while maintaining visual feedback

### Requirement 7: Responsive Controls and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game to be responsive and accessible, so that I can play comfortably regardless of my setup or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game loads THEN the system SHALL detect and adapt to different screen sizes
2. WHEN the player types THEN the system SHALL register keystrokes with minimal latency
3. WHEN accessibility options are needed THEN the system SHALL provide high contrast modes and font size options
4. WHEN the player uses different keyboards THEN the system SHALL support various keyboard layouts
5. IF the player has motor difficulties THEN the system SHALL offer adjustable timing and difficulty settings
